# SECURE WORLD
<!--blockquote-->
__In today's world we can't live without one thing and that is called DATA.__
__Data has become an unavoidable factor in modern world.__
__Looking back to the beginning of 2020 what all we learn new is innumerable.__
__It is considered to be an evolutionary time for cyber and privacy.__
__Businesses were not as prepared as they thought to spin up safe, secure, and functional remote environments.__
__A large emphasis for companies in the past few years has been embracing technology, and especially cloud-based technologies, to more efficiently and effectively run the business.__
__In March, there was a massive scramble to purchase hardware and software that would allow employees to easily work from home. And, for many companies, the considerations of privacy and security took a backseat to operations and just making it work. On top of the rush to provide the tools, many teams faced the challenges of how to collaborate and communicate in these distributed workforces, while many of us were also dealing with personal life challenges, as well.__
__cyberattacks are now impacting the physical health of individuals.__
__There has long been predictions that the harms done in the digital world would result in physical harm. And 2020 gave us a prime example of how these predictions are now coming true. In September 2020, a woman seeking medical care in Germany died when she was turned away from a hospital. The hospital was unable to admit her into their hospital due to a cyberattack that locked them out of their systems.__
__We, as system users, continue to be our own worst enemy in securing our systems.__
__For a number of years, security professionals have been sounding the alarm of cyber risks. __
__The 2020 Verizon Breach Report recognizes that phishing attacks are still one of the top attacks that entities face. Phishing attacks really boil down to us and our ability to withstand creative and effective ways for perpetrators to gain access to our systems. This is even more of an issue in 2020, when our attention has been completely taken over by the pandemic and a daily mental bombardment of news.__
__It will not be easy for us in the coming years to cope with today's cyber attacks. We must practice and prepare ourslves for this coming years and aware of the threats and insecurities towards our data and privacy.__
